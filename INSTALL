Installation Instructions for Gscope Packages
*********************************************

Gscope is provided in the form of two packages:
    1. gscope  - The GTK2 based implementation.
    2. gscope3 - The GTK3 based implementation.

Either package can be found in the "packages" subdirectory of the gscope repo.

Most of the gscope3 functional code is shared by both versions with only minimal adaptation.
The build/install process is intended to be identical for either package and these
instructions will apply to both packages.

Go to the gscope (or gscope3) package directory <repo>/packages/gscope.

Run the autogen tools to create the initial makefiles, etc...

# sh autogen.sh

Run "configure" to update the default package configuration settings.  For example:

# ./configure --prefix=/usr

Now run make

# make

If you have sufficient permission to write to the location specified by --PREFIX then
you can install the bits with this command

# make install

If you need to install gscope manually, the gscope executable will be created
in <repo>/packages/gscope[3]/src/gscope

The gscope binary is a standalone executable that can be installed most anywhere desired.

Exception Alert:
The gscope binary for the gscope3 package requires gscope3.glade to be copied to the same
location as the gscope3 binary.  This requirement may be relaxed in the future.

In addition to the binary, the Gscope pixmaps must also be installed in the proper
location beneath the --PREFIX path.
